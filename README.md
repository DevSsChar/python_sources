## Includes
- Create a data frame with columns 
- Generate a bar chart 
- Load the Dataset
- Analyse the Relationship Between Dependent and Independent Variables
- Check the Correlation Between Independent Variables
- Based on correlation:
1. Which independent variables are most useful in predicting
2. Are any variables redundant due to high correlation?
3. Suggest 1â€“2 variables that could be dropped in a model due to multicollinearity
- Create new derived features from existing data:
- Compute Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to identify redundant variables
Drop or combine variables with high VIF
- OLS Regression Modeling
1. Fit a regression model:
2. First with original features
3. Then with enhanced features after feature engineering
4. Evaluate the model using RMSE and R2Score.

5. ## Rest Practical Wise in respective md files
