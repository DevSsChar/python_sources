- Load the dataset using Pandas.
- Handle missing values and perform data cleaning.
- Select relevant independent variables (e.g., advertising budget, location, product category for sales; humidity, altitude for temperature; house size, number of rooms for housing prices).
- Plot histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.
- Normalize or transform data if necessary.
- Use from statsmodels to train the regression model.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Fit the model and interpret coefficients.
- Use for model evaluation.
- Identify key predictors and their impact on the dependent variable.
- Analyze residuals to check for model validity.
